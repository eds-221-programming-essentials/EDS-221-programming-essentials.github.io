```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)
```

## 1. Setup

- Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/eds-221-programming-essentials/eds-221-day8-activity)
- Clone to make a version controlled R Project
- Add folders `docs` and `figs`

## Task 1: Do your data viz worst

Just like it takes a lot of work to make a really wonderful graph, it takes effort to make a graph really awful. Put effort and creativity into this - you will learn a lot in the process if you do. 

Using the ‘space_launches.csv’ data, create a new .qmd and create your worst possible graph by customizing (from the ggplot default) in **at least 8 ways** - more encouraged - to make it as terrible as possible. The data were previously shared for #TidyTuesday, and descriptions of dataset & variables can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-15). You can plot whatever variable(s) you choose, and make whatever graph type you want.

**Once you're done, drop your worst graph (as a .png or .jpg) into the course Slack channel.** 

Some ideas: 

- fonts
- background images
- coord_*
- panel / plot / geom / text colors
- point / line patterns and shapes
- gridline updates
- tickmark frequency
- angles

Here's some inspiration from a few Bren MESM students. 

By Yani Pohl: 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("course-materials", "eod-practice", "images", "worst_yani_pohl.png"))
```

By Keene Morrow:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("course-materials", "eod-practice", "images", "worst_keene_morrow.png"))
```

## Task 2: Wrangling practice with the SF Greenhouse Gas data

- Download the San_Francisco_Communitywide_Greenhouse_Gas_Inventory.csv file. Information about the data is available [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Energy-and-Environment/San-Francisco-Communitywide-Greenhouse-Gas-Invento/btm4-e4ak/about_data).
```{r, include = FALSE}
sf_ghg <- read_csv(here("course-materials", "eod-practice", "data", "San_Francisco_Communitywide_Greenhouse_Gas_Inventory.csv"))
```

- Read in the SF emissions dataset, then complete the following: 

1. Create a summary table of total annual greenhouse gas emissions (only from Emissions_mtCO2e column) by sector_general

2. Create a summary table of total annual greenhouse gas emissions (only from Emissions_mtCO2e column) by year and commodity type

3. Create a subset of the data that only contains observations from 2005 on, only for observations where `Sector_Detail2` contains the pattern "PG&E", then limit to columns `Calendar_Year`, `Sector_Detail2` and `Emissions_mtCO2e`.  


## Task 3: Do your data viz best

Create a finalized graph (as perfect as you can make it) using the San Francisco GHG emissions dataset. **You** get to choose what you want to visualize. You can pick which variables & observations you're interested in. You may want to do some wrangling / summarizing first. 

Once you've decided on what to plot, create the best graph that you can to communicate what's going on with the data. 

**Once you're done, drop your best graph (as a .png or .jpg) into the course Slack channel.**
